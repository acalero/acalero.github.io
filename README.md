Website / Antonio Calero
=========================

This is my personal website / blog in github. It has been migrated from blogger to github pages for full control and advantages of the static site.

The blog is developed using Jekyll with the [Freelancer bootstrap theme ](http://startbootstrap.com/templates/freelancer/). Freelancer is a Jekyll theme which is very simple, clean and beautiful.

The theme has been modified to include blog posts, seo, sitemap and search by categories.
